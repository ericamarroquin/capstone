## Dec 10th To-Do: Plan the back end

- 8:30am: comb through C# lessons for building an API
  - I know theres a lesson on how to quick start an MVC app..
  - C# Building an API lesson 2 - scaffolding
  - Do I need the whole MVC, or just MC?
  - I know a will need two repositories, one for front, one for back

- 9:30am: Rereading through the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/older-versions/build-restful-apis-with-aspnet-web-api) for building an API

- 10am: Adding the capstone proposal to README that I totally forgot about last week

- 10:30am: Finally ready to build her! First step: design!

- 11am: Things to include in the database: 
  - Show name
  - Show genre

- 11:20am: This is proving to be more difficult than anticipated (i literally don't remember anything how am i going to get a job)
