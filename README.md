# Name TBD

### PURPOSE

"Name TBD" is an application that allows a user to track the TV shows they are watching. The user will be able to enter the show name, genre, amount of episodes, and actors in the show. Users will then be able to determine what their favorite genres are and what actors they enjoy watching. 

### MVP

1. Create "Name TBD" API containing information about a users favorite shows using C# with full CRUD endpoints
2. A React front end allowing the user to browse through show entries and update them as more shows are watched
3. User authentication and authorization using auth0

### TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR MVP

- React.jS
- C#/.NET5
- MySQL

### EXTRA FEATURES

1. Allow user to view their data, a la Spotify Wrapped
  - ex: "Your top genre is: drama, you've spent x hours watching it"
2. Create a enjoyable and visually appealing user experience

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Python with the Pandas and Numpy libraries

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- If this fails miserably and I realize I don't understand crypto, I'll be making a workout/meal plan iOS app to track macros and user inputted recipes
