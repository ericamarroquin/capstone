Name of Student: Erica Marroquin

Name of Project: ErCoin - this is changing

Project's Purpose or Goal: 

- Allow users to 'purchase' ErCoin, view graphs of current crypto trends, and see how ErCoin is valued against current crypto

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal: 

- User authentication and authorization
- Allow users to purchase ErCoin
- Pull data from APIs to create interactive graphs
- Plot ErCoin data against other currency data from APIs

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- React.js, C#/.NET, MySQL, charts.js, d3.js
- APIs: Brave NewCoin, CoinLib (this might change depending on API call limit)

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- I want to dive into some data science concepts, potentially using linear regression to map out how 'successful' the coin will be in the future days/weeks, compared to others pulled from the API

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Python with the Pandas and Numpy libraries

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- If this fails miserably and I realize I don't understand crypto, I'll be making a workout/meal plan iOS app to track macros and user inputted recipes
