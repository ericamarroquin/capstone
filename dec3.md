- desperately trying to figure out how to connect React and C#
- im grasping at straws here
- bridge.NET not common, on to the next one

- [this](https://alialhaddad.medium.com/build-a-basic-fullstack-app-using-c-net-core-mysql-and-webpack-react-1-3-73cfb64daeb6) looks promising, it uses all the tools we already know

- IM VERY CONFUSED

- this was in fact not helpful and now im more confused

- now im looking up using charts.js in react which feels more palpable

- shes following [this](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-chart-js-react/)
- - omg if you type `react.new` in a new browser tab it takes you to a react playground??? 

- its broken and everything is meaningless
