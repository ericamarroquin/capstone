- desperately trying to figure out how to connect React and C#
- im grasping at straws here
- bridge.NET not common, on to the next one

- [this](https://alialhaddad.medium.com/build-a-basic-fullstack-app-using-c-net-core-mysql-and-webpack-react-1-3-73cfb64daeb6) looks promising, it uses all the tools we already know

- IM VERY CONFUSED

- this was in fact not helpful and now im more confused
